# BinarySearchTree
Develop a generic typed collection class BinarySearchTree (binary search tree).
Provide for the class the possibility of using a custom interface to implement the ordering relationship for its elements.
Implement three ways to traverse the tree (to implement traversals, you can use the (yield) iterator block):
straight (preorder),
transverse (inorder),
reverse (postorder):
Test the designed class using the following types:
System.Int32 (use default comparison and custom comparator);
System.String (use default comparison and custom comparator);
custom class Book, for objects of which order relations are implemented (use default comparison and custom comparator);
a custom Time structure for instances of which ordering relationships are not implemented (use a custom comparator).
